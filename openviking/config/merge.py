"""Three-state PATCH merge and copy-on-write helpers.

The same three-state PATCH semantics apply to each independent config scope:

- field absent: keep current value.
- field is a concrete value: set/replace.
- field is ``None``: remove the value from this scope.

Objects merge recursively, arrays replace wholesale.

What an absent value means is deliberately outside this helper. A business
resolver may supply a default, reject the operation, or consult Cluster
configuration. Legacy ``RuntimeField.fallback`` is a separate compatibility
mechanism and is not implemented by this merge function.
