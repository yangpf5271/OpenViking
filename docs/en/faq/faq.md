# FAQ

## Basic Concepts

### What is OpenViking? What problems does it solve?

OpenViking organizes an agent's resources, memories, and skills as files. Applications can browse paths, search semantically, and read content on demand. They can also retain preferences and experience extracted from sessions for later tasks.

It targets four common problems when building agents:

- **Fragmented context**: memories, resources, and skills live in different places and are hard to manage together
- **Weak retrieval**: flat chunk storage loses the surrounding structure, so results lack the full context
- **Opaque retrieval**: implicit retrieval chains are hard to inspect when results go wrong
- **Limited memory iteration**: agents lack task memory that improves across sessions

For example, an agent revising a deployment plan can search project documentation and read the relevant configuration. Constraints agreed in an earlier session can also be retrieved and reused if they were extracted as memories. The application must connect retrieval and session submission; installing the database alone does not give an agent this context. Start by [importing and searching a resource](../getting-started/02-quickstart.md), then connect an [agent tool](../agent-integrations/01-overview.md) if needed.

### What's the fundamental difference between OpenViking and traditional vector databases?

A vector database primarily stores vectors and supports similarity search. OpenViking adds context directories, layered summaries, resource ingestion, sessions, and memory management. Vector database capabilities vary by product; compare them against your requirements.

| Need | OpenViking capability |
| --- | --- |
| Organize context | Manage resources, memories, and skills through `viking://` paths |
| Retrieve content | Run vector search within a directory scope, with configurable intent analysis and reranking |
| Control how much to read | Read directory abstracts or overviews before loading details |
| Reuse session experience | Extract and update memories after a session is committed, following the memory policy |
| Diagnose retrieval problems | Inspect processing and retrieval through logs and telemetry |

If your application only needs similarity queries over existing vectors, evaluate whether its current database is sufficient. Consider OpenViking when you also need directory browsing, layered reading of summaries and details, or memory across sessions. Compare retrieved content, reading volume, latency, and processing cost using your own data and representative questions; benefits depend on the data, models, and configuration.

### What is the L0/L1/L2 layered model? Why is it needed?

An agent can use summaries to locate relevant material before reading full content, reducing unrelated content in its context.

| Layer | Content | Default body target | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Directory abstract, `.abstract.md` | 256 characters | Retrieval and quick filtering |
| L1 | Directory overview, `.overview.md` | 4,000 characters | Navigation and reranking |
| L2 | Original or parsed content | No shared limit | Reading details on demand |

L0/L1 are directory sidecars. Their availability depends on processing state and configuration. Generated resource summaries use character targets configured through `semantic.abstract_max_chars` and `semantic.overview_max_chars`. Truncation preserves complete sentences, so the first sentence can exceed the target; these are not hard limits on stored sidecars. See [Context Layers](../concepts/03-context-layers.md).

### What is Viking URI? What's its purpose?

Viking URI is OpenViking's unified resource identifier, formatted as `viking://{scope}/{path}`. It enables precise location of any context:

```
viking://
├── resources/              # Knowledge base: documents, code, web pages, etc.
│   └── my_project/
├── user/
│   └── {user_id}/          # Private context for a user
│       ├── memories/       # User memories
│       ├── resources/      # Private user resources
│       ├── skills/         # Private user skills (default)
│       └── peers/{peer_id}/
│           ├── memories/   # Memories scoped to a peer
│           └── resources/  # Resources scoped to a peer
└── agent/                  # Optional account-wide Agent capabilities
    └── skills/             # Shared skills
```

## Installation & Configuration

### What are the environment requirements?

- **Python Version**: 3.10 or higher
- **Build Tools** (if installing from source or on unsupported platforms): Rust/Cargo, GCC 9+ or Clang 11+
- **Required Dependencies**: Embedding model (Volcengine Doubao recommended)
- **Optional Dependencies**:
  - VLM (Vision Language Model): For multimodal content processing and semantic extraction
  - Rerank model: For improved retrieval precision

### How does OpenViking access the AGFS filesystem?

OpenViking runs the RAGFS filesystem in-process through the Rust binding
(`ragfs_python` / `RAGFSBindingClient`). The binding executes filesystem logic
directly within the Python process; remote storage backends still make network requests. The RAGFS shared library ships in prebuilt wheels and can also be built from source.

> [!WARNING]
> OpenViking no longer supports the AGFS HTTP client mode. AGFS / RAGFS filesystem access now happens only through the in-process Rust binding (`RAGFSBindingClient`). This does not affect the OpenViking server HTTP API, the `ov` CLI, or `AsyncHTTPClient` / `SyncHTTPClient` when they connect to an OpenViking server.

### What should I do if I encounter "AGFS binding library not found"?

This usually means the RAGFS shared library is missing or cannot be loaded. Check whether a prebuilt wheel exists for your Python version and platform, then try reinstalling. [Build from source](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) only if no wheel is available or you need to change the source; that path requires the native build toolchain.

### How do I install/upgrade OpenViking?

```bash
pip install openviking --upgrade --force-reinstall

```

### How do I configure OpenViking?

Create `~/.openviking/ov.conf` under your home directory. Replace the example models and credentials with your own:

```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "dense": {
      "provider": "volcengine",
      "api_key": "your-api-key",
      "model": "doubao-embedding-vision-251215",
      "dimension": 1024,
      "input": "multimodal"
    }
  },
  "vlm": {
    "provider": "volcengine",
    "api_key": "your-api-key",
    "model": "doubao-seed-2-0-lite-260428",
    "api_base": "https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3"
  },
  "rerank": {
    "provider": "vikingdb",
    "ak": "your-access-key",
    "sk": "your-secret-key",
    "model_name": "doubao-seed-rerank",
    "model_version": "251028"
  },
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "./data",
    "agfs": { "backend": "local" },
    "vectordb": { "backend": "local" }
  }
}
```

Config files at the default path `~/.openviking/ov.conf` are loaded automatically; you can also specify a different path via the `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable or `--config` flag. See [Configuration Guide](../guides/01-configuration.md) for details.

### What Embedding providers are supported?

| Provider | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `volcengine` | Volcengine Embedding API (Recommended) |
| `openai` | OpenAI Embedding API |
| `vikingdb` | VikingDB Embedding API |
| `jina` | Jina AI Embedding API |
| `ollama` | Ollama (local OpenAI-compatible server, no API key required) |

Supports Dense, Sparse, and Hybrid embedding modes.

## Usage Guide

### How do I initialize the client?

```python
from openviking_sdk import SyncHTTPClient

client = SyncHTTPClient(url="http://localhost:1933", api_key="your-key")
client.initialize()
```

Embedding, VLM, storage, and other service configuration is managed by the OpenViking Server through `ov.conf`.

### What file formats are supported?

| Type | Supported Formats |
|------|-------------------|
| **Text** | `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.yaml` |
| **Code** | `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.java`, `.cpp`, etc. |
| **Documents** | `.pdf`, `.docx` |
| **Images** | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp` |
| **Video** | `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi` |
| **Audio** | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a` |

### How do I add resources?

```python
# Add single file
client.add_resource(
    path="./document.pdf",
    parent="viking://resources",  # Store under this directory; the name comes from the source
    options={"reason": "Project technical documentation"},  # Used for L0/L1 summaries when no instruction is given, and for resource-linked memory extraction
)

# Add web page
client.add_resource(
    path="https://example.com/api-docs",
    options={"reason": "API reference documentation"},
)

# Wait for processing to complete
client.wait_processed()
```

### What is the difference between `to` and `parent`? Which should I use?

|  | `to` | `parent` |
|---|---|---|
| What you pass | The exact final URI, **including the leaf name** | An **existing directory**; the leaf name comes from the source |
| On a name collision | No renaming. An existing target directory is synced to the new source, so visible entries the source does not contain are deleted | Never overwrites. Falls back to `name_1`, `name_2`, … and returns a warning |
| When to use it | The final name is known and must be honored verbatim, or you want to update an existing resource in place | The leaf name is derived server-side (URL / repository imports, split documents), or nothing already at the destination may be touched |

Leaving both empty derives the directory and the leaf name from the source, with the same collision handling as `parent`. As an exception to exact-target behavior, `to` set to a resource namespace root such as `viking://resources` acts as a parent. Resource roots are created when needed; for other missing parents, pass `options={"create_parent": True}`.

`to` and `parent` cannot be combined; passing both is an error.

### What happens when `to` points at an existing directory?

The content is synced to match the new source and the metadata is kept:

- **Dot-prefixed entries survive untouched** — `.abstract.md`, `.overview.md`, `.search_tags.json`, `.image_mappings.json` and friends. The sync enumerates neither side's dotfiles, so they are neither deleted nor overwritten.
- **Everything else visible is aligned with the source** — entries the source does not contain are deleted, changed ones are overwritten, unchanged ones stay in place and keep their URI, vectors and tags.

So this preserves metadata and replaces the content itself; it is not a delete-and-recreate. Use `parent` when nothing already at the destination may be touched.

Note: `processing_mode="vectors_only"` skips semantic processing, so the surviving `.abstract.md` / `.overview.md` are **not** regenerated and keep describing the content that was just replaced. Use the default `semantic_and_vectors` when summaries must follow the content.

### What's the difference between `find()` and `search()`? Which should I use?

| Feature | `find()` | `search()` |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Session Context** | Not used | Optional; used when `session_id` is supplied and intent analysis is enabled |
| **Intent Analysis** | Not used | Uses an LLM when session content exists and intent analysis is enabled |
| **Latency** | Depends on embedding, retrieval, and reranking | Intent analysis adds an LLM call when used |
| **Use Case** | Simple semantic search | Complex tasks requiring context understanding |

```python
# find(): Simple direct semantic search
results = client.find(
    query="OAuth authentication flow",
    target_uri="viking://resources/",
)

# search(): Complex tasks requiring intent analysis
results = client.search(
    query="Help me implement user login functionality",
    session_id=session.session_id,
)
```

**Selection Guide**:
- Know exactly what you're looking for → Use `find()`
- Complex tasks needing multiple context types → Use `search()`

### How do I use session management?

Session management is a core capability of OpenViking, supporting conversation tracking and memory extraction:

```python
from openviking_sdk import TextPart

# Create session
session_info = client.create_session()
session = client.session(session_id=session_info["session_id"])

# Add conversation messages
session.add_message(
    role="user",
    parts=[TextPart(text="Help me analyze performance issues in this code")],
)
session.add_message(
    role="assistant",
    parts=[TextPart(text="Let me analyze...")],
)

# Commit session to trigger memory extraction
session.commit()
```

### What memory types does OpenViking support?

OpenViking includes memory types such as `profile`, `preferences`, `entities`, `events`, `identity`, `soul`, `cases`, `trajectories`, and `experiences`. After a session is committed, the active memory policy determines which useful information to extract. Applications can also extend or adjust the memory types for their own needs.

Memories are stored in the current User or Peer namespace; there is no current writable `viking://agent/memories` directory. See [Context Types](../concepts/02-context-types.md) for the complete type and path mapping.

### How do I use Unix-like filesystem APIs?

```python
# List directory contents
items = client.ls(uri="viking://resources/")

# Read full content (L2)
content = client.read(uri="viking://resources/doc.md")

# Get abstract (L0)
abstract = client.abstract(uri="viking://resources")

# Get overview (L1)
overview = client.overview(uri="viking://resources")
```

## Retrieval Optimization

### How do I improve retrieval quality?

1. **Check summaries**: Verify that L0/L1 represent the source accurately; adjust the import `instruction` or summary templates when needed
2. **Organize directories**: Import with `parent` for an existing parent directory or `to` for an exact target URI
3. **Use session context**: Keep `retrieval.enable_intent` on (default) and pass a session with content to `search()`
4. **Choose appropriate Embedding mode**: Use `multimodal` input for multimodal content
5. **Evaluate reranking**: Compare ranking results with and without reranking on representative queries before enabling it. You can try Jev (TypeSafe System One) as the rerank provider: it judges each candidate's relevance to the query independently, so candidate scores do not compete. See the [Configuration Guide](../guides/01-configuration.md#rerank) for setup

### How is the retrieval result score calculated?

Results use vector scores directly when reranking is disabled. When reranking is enabled, its scores determine the final ranking; failed requests or invalid rerank results fall back to vector scores. Access frequency, update time, and parent-directory scores do not add any weight.

### How does global retrieval work?

Each query runs one global vector search within its directory scope, permission filters, and requested levels. THINKING with a usable reranker recalls at most `2 × limit` candidates, reranks them once, and returns at most `limit` results. Without reranking, it recalls `limit` hits directly. Retrieval does not navigate directories recursively or trigger further searches after reranking.

## Troubleshooting

### Resources not being indexed after adding

**Possible causes and solutions**:

1. **Didn't wait for processing to complete**
   ```python
   result = client.add_resource(path="./doc.pdf", wait=True)
   print(result)
   ```
   Use `wait=True` for a new import. To inspect an import already submitted, query its returned `task_id` instead of importing it again. Keep waiting while its status is `pending` or `running`; inspect the task details if it is `failed` or `cancelled`. A request timeout alone does not mean the background task failed. See [Async Tasks](../api/17-tasks.md).

2. **Embedding model configuration error**
   - Check if `api_key` in `~/.openviking/ov.conf` is correct
   - Confirm model name and endpoint are configured correctly

3. **Unsupported file format**
   - Check if file extension is in the supported list
   - Confirm file content is valid and not corrupted

4. **View server-side processing logs**
   Inspect the task error in the server terminal or logging system. Python logging settings in a client do not enable logs on a remote server.

### Search not returning expected results

**Troubleshooting steps**:

1. **Confirm resources exist, then check the import task**
   Use the `task_id` returned by the import. `completed` means processing has finished; inspect the cause if the task is `failed` or `cancelled`.
   ```python
   # Check if resources exist
   items = client.ls(uri="viking://resources/")
   task = client.get_task("<task_id returned by the import>")
   print(task["status"] if task is not None else "Task not found or expired")
   ```

2. **Check `target_uri` filter condition**
   - Ensure search scope includes target resources
   - Try expanding search scope

3. **Try different query approaches**
   - Use more specific or broader keywords
   - Compare effects of `find()` and `search()`

4. **Check L0 abstract quality**
   ```python
   abstract = client.abstract(uri="viking://resources/your-doc")
   print(abstract)  # Confirm abstract accurately reflects content
   ```

### Memory extraction not working

**Troubleshooting steps**:

1. **Ensure `commit()` was called**
   ```python
   session.commit()  # Triggers memory extraction
   ```

2. **Check VLM configuration**
   - Memory extraction requires VLM model
   - Confirm `vlm` configuration is correct

3. **Confirm conversation content is meaningful**
   - Casual chat may not produce memories
   - Needs to contain extractable information (preferences, entities, events, etc.)

4. **List the memory directory**
   ```python
   memories = client.ls(uri="viking://~/memories/")
   ```

### Performance issues

**Optimization suggestions**:

1. **Locate the bottleneck**: Inspect queues, model latency, and storage time before changing concurrency
2. **Set appropriate `batch_size`**: Adjust batch processing size in Embedding configuration
3. **Use local storage**: Use `local` backend during development to reduce network latency
4. **Async operations**: Use `AsyncHTTPClient` when your application already runs an event loop (FastAPI, agent frameworks); `SyncHTTPClient` wraps it for scripts and notebooks

## Deployment

### Is OpenViking open source?

The main project uses AGPLv3; the CLI and most examples use Apache 2.0. See the repository [license summary](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking#license) for component licenses and exceptions.
