# Resource Access Control (ACL)

OpenViking ACL shares directories or files from the shared resource scope with users or groups inside one account. ACL never changes the account boundary: every grant is limited to the current account.

ACL uses a collaborative-document inheritance model. A directory grant applies to descendants by default. Child directories and files can add direct grants or establish a restricted boundary that ignores inherited permissions.

## Supported URIs

ACL applies only to shared resources:

```text
viking://resources/...
```

- An account `ADMIN` implicitly has `manage` on `viking://resources/...`.
- `viking://resources` is a fixed shared scope and cannot carry a direct ACL. ACLs start on files and directories below it.
- `viking://user/{user_id}/resources/...` is private and does not accept ACLs. To share it, move the resource into a writable shared directory and inherit that directory's ACL.

Implicit management is not stored as an ACL entry and cannot be removed by ACL changes. It ensures that shared resources always have an identity that can establish or recover permissions.

## Principals and Levels

ACL entries use typed principals:

- `user:{user_id}`: a user in the current account.
- `group:{group_id}`: a caller-supplied, account-unique group ID.
- `user:*`: any user in the current account.

`group:*` is not supported. Groups are flat. Membership changes do not rewrite resource ACL or context records; they take effect when the next request builds `RequestContext.group_ids`.
Asynchronous parse and semantic tasks created by a request carry the same group identity. After an `add-resource` destination write has been authorized, automatic semantic maintenance preserves that identity and uses an explicit internal ACL bypass instead of changing the caller's role.

| Level | Allowed operations |
|-------|--------------------|
| `read` | Read, list, and `find/search/grep` |
| `write` | `read` capabilities plus write, create, file delete/move, and tag updates |
| `manage` | `write` capabilities plus directory delete/move and ACL management |

Each higher level includes the lower levels. A `manage` grant therefore includes `read` and `write`.

## Inheritance

A normal node combines direct and inherited grants. A restricted node uses only direct grants:

```text
effective(node) = direct(node) + (acl_mode(node) == "restricted" ? empty : inherited(node))
```

`inherited(node)` always stores the parent's current effective permissions. It continues to refresh while the node is restricted, and disabling restricted mode applies the latest inherited value immediately. Descendants inherit the current node's effective permissions, so they cannot bypass an intermediate restricted boundary.

For example:

```text
read user:bob   on viking://resources/A
write group:engineering on viking://resources/A/B
read user:carol on viking://resources/A/B/C/report.md
```

The effective permissions on `report.md` are:

- Bob: `read`
- Members of `engineering`: `write`
- Carol: `read`

If `A/B` becomes restricted, Bob's grant on `A` no longer applies to `A/B` or its descendants, but the stored inherited value is not deleted. Disabling restricted mode immediately restores Bob's inherited access.

## Default Behavior and `acl_mode`

The account-level `acl.enabled` setting is disabled by default. While disabled,
shared resources keep the existing URI namespace visibility and write rules.
ACLs are neither resolved nor enforced, and new content does not receive ACL
fields.

When enabled, a newly created shared file or directory grants its creator direct
`manage` on its first context record, and parent permissions are merged as
inherited ACL. Existing content without an ACL is not migrated or modified and
remains public. Disabling the setting also stops enforcing existing ACLs.
`add-resource` treats only the generated import root (or the root file with
`no_split`) as the created node: the root gets the direct creator grant and
descendants only inherit it. Re-embedding or replacing an existing context record
does not change its direct ACL.

`acl_mode` describes a resource's ACL behavior, separately from the account-wide `acl.enabled` switch:

- `none`: use the original visibility rules without resource ACL enforcement.
- `inherit`: use direct grants and permissions inherited from the parent.
- `restricted`: use direct grants only, while retaining and refreshing inherited grants.

Users with `manage` can switch between `inherit` and `restricted`, but cannot set `none` to bypass the parent's ACL. After exiting restricted mode, a node without direct grants returns to `none` if its parent is not ACL-controlled. A restricted node with no direct grants remains protected, as do descendants without separate grants; account administrators retain implicit management access.

## File Operations

All filesystem APIs use the same permission mapping:

| Operation | Required capability |
|-----------|---------------------|
| read, stat, list, tree, find, search, grep, glob | read |
| write, create, mkdir, set tags | write |
| delete or move a file | write |
| delete or move a directory | manage on the directory and complete subtree |
| manage ACL | manage |
| move destination parent | write |

The server canonicalizes the URI, then uses one authorization entry point for account/owner/actor-peer boundaries, the effective ACL or legacy fallback, and write/delete namespace guards.

When the account enables `acl.enabled`, a new shared node is bootstrapped by its
creator's direct `manage` grant. Later ACL changes require effective `manage`
capability.

An ACL grant on a directory is inherited by every descendant. `list`, `tree`, and other batch results still check every returned node because an ACL-free directory may be visible under legacy URI rules while one of its descendants has entered the ACL-controlled domain through its own ACL.

Within the shared scope, a moved node keeps its direct ACL and restricted state, then recalculates inherited permissions from its new parent. A private resource moved into the shared scope carries no ACL and inherits the destination directory; a shared resource moved back to a private area has its ACL cleared.

Recursive tag updates, directory deletion, and directory moves validate the complete affected subtree first. The operation stops if any node lacks the required capability or the subtree cannot be scanned completely.

For a directory, `stat.count` uses the same path and ACL scalar filter and reports the number of context records visible to the caller.

## Retrieval Filtering

ACL data exists only in the context collection. Each context record stores direct and inherited permissions in native scalar fields:

```text
acl_mode
acl_direct_grants
acl_inherited_grants
```

`acl_direct_grants` is the ACL assigned to the current node. `acl_inherited_grants` stores the parent's current effective ACL. `acl_mode` controls whether inherited grants contribute to the current node's effective permissions. Each principal stores only its highest level as `{mask}:{principal}`: `1` means `read`, `3` means `write`, and `7` means `manage`. There is no separate ACL collection.

The request principals are `user:{ctx.user_id}`, `user:*`, and one `group:{group_id}` for each ID in `ctx.group_ids`. Within the shared scope, retrieval identifies controlled records with `acl_mode IN [inherit, restricted]`, then matches each principal's `1`, `3`, and `7` grant tokens: direct or inherited for inherit mode, direct only for restricted mode. Missing, `null`, and `none` modes retain legacy visibility rules and are neither dropped nor mistaken for ACL-controlled records. Private resources remain isolated by URI owner.

A retrieval target URI is only a search scope; the caller does not need to read the target node itself. A user can discover a deeply shared file even when intermediate directories are not readable.

When the account enables `acl.enabled`, shared-scope context writes preserve an
existing direct ACL for the same URI. A newly created node receives direct
`manage` for its creator and derives inherited ACL fields from its parent.
Descendants created by `add-resource` only inherit from the import root.
Re-embedding and ordinary replacement writes cannot reset controlled records to
default visibility or modify ACLs through regular context fields. When the
account disables the switch, retrieval uses only the original account and URI
scope filters and ignores these ACL fields.

## Example

Grant Bob read-only access to a directory:

```bash
ov acl grant viking://resources/project-a --principal user:bob --level read
```

Bob can read and retrieve descendants, but cannot write or delete them. Upgrade the grant to `write`:

```bash
ov acl grant viking://resources/project-a --principal user:bob --level write
```

Remove Bob's direct grant from this node:

```bash
ov acl revoke viking://resources/project-a --principal user:bob
```

If an ancestor still grants Bob access, that inherited permission remains effective.

Use only direct grants on the current node while preserving and refreshing inherited grants:

```bash
ov acl set viking://resources/project-a --acl-mode restricted
```
