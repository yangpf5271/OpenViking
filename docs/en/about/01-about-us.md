# Team & Org

## Project Overview

OpenViking is an open-source context database for AI agents, initiated and maintained by the Viking team at ByteDance's Volcengine. It organizes resources, memories, and skills as files that agents can browse, search, and read on demand.

## Team Introduction

### Viking Team Background

The Viking team develops vector retrieval, knowledge base, and memory management products. Its dozens of engineers work across distributed systems, machine learning, data engineering, and AI algorithms, and have run context engineering in commercial production. OpenViking applies that engineering experience to a context database developed with the open-source community.

#### Core Technical Capabilities

**Large-Scale Vector Retrieval System**
- Supports real-time retrieval and similarity computation over hundreds of millions of vectors
- Delivers millisecond-level latency to meet high-concurrency business scenarios
- Supports hybrid retrieval strategies combining semantic similarity and keyword matching

**Multimodal Content Understanding Engine**
- Supports intelligent parsing for text, images, audio, video, and more
- Achieves cross-modal semantic association and content understanding
- Provides unified content abstraction and semantic representation

**Distributed System Architecture Design**
- Extensive experience building highly available, scalable distributed systems
- Supports elastic scaling and automatic failure recovery
- Balances data consistency and system performance

This work involves three related problems: extracting searchable information from unstructured content, finding relevant context among many candidates, and retaining interaction experience for later tasks. OpenViking addresses these through [resource parsing and extraction](../concepts/06-extraction.md), [context retrieval](../concepts/07-retrieval.md), and [session and memory management](../concepts/08-session.md). These pages explain the implementation and conditions for use.

### Development History and Technical Evolution

| Time Period | Milestone | Technical Breakthroughs and Industry Impact |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **2019–2023** | VikingDB vector database widely adopted inside ByteDance | Powered multiple core products’ unstructured information retrieval; accumulated engineering experience in large-scale vector retrieval; validated the technical value of vector databases in real-world business scenarios |
| **2024** | Released developer-facing product matrix: VikingDB, Viking Knowledge Base, Viking Memory Base | Officially provided on Volcano Engine public cloud; successfully supported thousands of enterprise customers building AI-native applications; marked the successful transition from internal tooling to commercial products |
| **2025** | Expanded to upper-layer applications such as AI Search and Knowledge Assistants | Built a complete product matrix from infrastructure to application layer; further validated business value across scenarios; formed a full loop from technology to product |
| **Late 2025** | Open-sourced [MineContext](https://github.com/volcengine/MineContext) project | Explored proactive AI application patterns; validated personal context engineering ideas; accumulated community operation experience for OpenViking |
| **Early 2026** | Open-sourced OpenViking project | Released a newly designed context database architecture for the global AI Agent ecosystem; marked the strategic shift from commercial product provider to open-source contributor |
