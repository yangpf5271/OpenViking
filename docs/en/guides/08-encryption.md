# Encryption Guide

This guide describes how to enable and use at-rest data encryption in OpenViking.

## Overview

OpenViking can encrypt newly written files with account-specific keys. The storage layer handles encryption and decryption through the existing APIs:

- **Transparent encryption**: No API changes, application layer unaware
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Different accounts use independent keys
- **Three key providers**: Local, Vault, Volcengine KMS
- **Backward compatible**: Unencrypted old files still readable

See [Data Encryption](../concepts/10-encryption.md) for conceptual explanations.

## Encryption in Multi-Write Storage

Multi-write storage reuses the same transparent encryption model. Encryption still happens inside RAGFS, so the Python SDK, HTTP API, and CLI do not need to handle encryption or decryption directly.

Rules:

- When global `encryption.enabled=true`, the primary backend must be encrypted.
- Each backup backend may control its own encryption through `encryption.enabled`.
- Multi-write internal metadata such as `.redirect.json` and `.sync_log.json` follows the primary backend's encryption policy.
- OpenViking does not expose and does not need public encryption APIs for operating on these internal files.

See the [Multi-Write Storage Guide](./13-multi-write-storage.md) for more multi-write configuration details.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Root Key (Local Mode)

```bash
ov system crypto init-key --output-file ~/.openviking/master.key
```

### 2. Configure Encryption

Merge the following encryption settings into `~/.openviking/ov.conf`; retain your model and server settings:

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "local",
    "local": {
      "key_file": "~/.openviking/master.key"
    }
  },
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "./data"
  }
}
```

### 3. Verify

Restart the server after changing encryption settings, and run this example against that server. Install the [Python SDK](../api/01-overview.md#using-python-sdk-client-without-configuration-file) in the environment running the script.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from openviking_sdk import SyncHTTPClient


def test():
    # OPENVIKING_API_KEY: use a tenant-bound user/admin key when authentication is enabled.
    client = SyncHTTPClient(url="http://localhost:1933")
    try:
        client.initialize()
        sample = Path("./encrypted-sample.txt")
        sample.write_text("Hello, encrypted world!", encoding="utf-8")
        imported = client.add_resource(
            path=str(sample),
            wait=True,
            timeout=120,
        )
        results = client.find(
            query="encrypted", target_uri=imported["root_uri"]
        )
        print(f"Found {len(results.get('resources', []))} resources")
    finally:
        client.close()


test()
```

It waits for import processing and checks retrieval; successful retrieval alone does not prove encryption at rest. Use [Check File Content](#method-1-check-file-content) to inspect the stored file header.

## API Key Hashing Configuration

File encryption and API key hashing are independent controls:

| Encryption Layer | Config | Algorithm | Reversible | Description |
|------------------|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **File Layer** | `encryption.enabled` | AES-GCM | Yes | Protects entire storage files |
| **API Key Field Layer** | `encryption.api_key_hashing.enabled` | Argon2id | No | Protects API keys themselves |

### Default Behavior

**By default, `encryption.api_key_hashing.enabled = false`**:
- API keys are stored in plaintext within JSON files
- If `encryption.enabled = true`, the entire file is protected by AES-GCM encryption
- `ov admin list-users` can display the full API key
- If `encryption.enabled = true` and API key hashing stays disabled, the server writes an informational log line about this at startup

### Enabling Argon2id Hashing

Enable Argon2id one-way hashing to stop storing recoverable API key values:

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "api_key_hashing": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: When enabled:
- API keys are stored using Argon2id one-way hashing
- Plaintext keys cannot be recovered from hash values
- `ov admin list-users` only shows `key_prefix` instead of the full API key
- Plaintext keys are only visible when creating users or regenerating keys

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "local",
    "local": {
      "key_file": "~/.openviking/master.key"
    },
    "api_key_hashing": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Choosing a Key Provider

| Provider | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **Local** | Dev environments, single-node | Simple, no external services | Requires local file permissions and separate key backups |
| **Vault** | Production, multi-cloud | Enterprise-grade KMS, version control | Requires deploying and maintaining Vault |
| **Volcengine KMS** | Volcengine cloud | Cloud-native KMS service | Volcengine-only |

---

## Local Mode Detailed Guide

### Initialize Root Key

```bash
# Generate and save to specified path
ov system crypto init-key --output-file ~/.openviking/master.key

# Or use short option
ov system crypto init-key -f ~/.openviking/master.key
```

**Output example**:
```
✓ Root key generated successfully
✓ Saved to: /Users/you/.openviking/master.key
```

### Security Tips

- ⚠️ Keep `master.key` safe
- Recommend setting file permissions to `600` (owner-only read/write)
- Regularly back up the key file
- Don't commit the key file to version control

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "local",
    "local": {
      "key_file": "~/.openviking/master.key"
    }
  }
}
```

## Vault Mode Detailed Guide

### Prerequisites

1. HashiCorp Vault service deployed; install the Python `hvac` dependency in the server environment
2. Transit engine enabled
3. Vault Token with sufficient permissions

### Configure Vault

1. Enable Transit engine (if not already enabled):

```bash
vault secrets enable transit
```

2. Enable KV engine (if not already enabled):

```bash
# KV v2 (recommended)
vault secrets enable -path=secret -version=2 kv

# Or KV v1
vault secrets enable -path=secret -version=1 kv
```

Use one KV command matching your deployment, not both. The example below uses the `secret` mount with KV v2. Pre-create the Transit key with an administrative token:

```bash
vault write -f transit/keys/openviking-root-key type=aes256-gcm96
```

3. Configure OpenViking:

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "vault",
    "vault": {
      "address": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
      "token": "hvs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "mount_point": "transit",
      "kv_mount_point": "secret",
      "kv_version": 2,
      "root_key_name": "openviking-root-key",
      "encrypted_root_key_key": "openviking-encrypted-root-key"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Parameters**:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `address` | Vault server address | Required |
| `token` | Vault authentication token | Required |
| `mount_point` | Transit engine mount path | `"transit"` |
| `kv_mount_point` | KV engine mount path | `"secret"` |
| `kv_version` | KV engine version (1 or 2) | `1` |
| `root_key_name` | Key name in Transit engine | `"openviking-root-key"` |
| `encrypted_root_key_key` | Path to store encrypted root key in KV engine | `"openviking-encrypted-root-key"` |

### Vault Permission Recommendations

For the configuration above, the service token needs Transit key metadata access, encrypt/decrypt access, and KV access to store the wrapped root key. With the engines and Transit key pre-created, a policy example is:

```hcl
path "auth/token/lookup-self" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "transit/keys/openviking-root-key" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "secret/data/openviking-encrypted-root-key" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create", "update"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/openviking-root-key" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}

path "transit/decrypt/openviking-root-key" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```

For KV v1, replace `secret/data/openviking-encrypted-root-key` with `secret/openviking-encrypted-root-key`. The provider also probes `sys/mounts`; denial is logged as a warning and does not stop startup when Transit is already enabled.

## Volcengine KMS Mode Detailed Guide

### Prerequisites

1. Volcengine KMS service activated
2. Symmetric key created
3. Valid Access Key and Secret Key

### Create KMS Key

1. Visit [Volcengine KMS Console](https://console.volcengine.com/kms)
2. Click "Create Key"
3. Select "Symmetric Key", algorithm `AES_256`
4. Record the Key ID

### Configure OpenViking

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "volcengine_kms",
    "volcengine_kms": {
      "key_id": "d926aa0d-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "region": "cn-beijing",
      "access_key": "AKLTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "secret_key": "Tmpxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "endpoint": null,
      "key_file": "~/.openviking/openviking-volcengine-root-key.enc"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Parameters**:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `key_id` | KMS Key ID | Required |
| `region` | Region | Required |
| `access_key` | Access Key | Required |
| `secret_key` | Secret Key | Required |
| `endpoint` | Custom KMS endpoint (optional) | `null` (use default endpoint) |
| `key_file` | Local cache file path for encrypted root key | `"~/.openviking/openviking-volcengine-root-key.enc"` |

### Permission Recommendations

Configure minimal permissions for the Access Key:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "trn:kms:*:*:key/d926aa0d-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verifying Encryption

### Method 1: Check File Content

Inspect the physical backend file, not the API response, which is decrypted. Substitute its actual path below. Encrypted files start with magic number `OVE1`:

```bash
# View first 4 bytes
hexdump -C ./data/agfs/your-file | head -1
```

**Encrypted file**:
```
00000000  4f 56 45 31 01 01 00 00  00 20 8a 7b 2c 9d 1e  |OVE1..... .{,..|
```
(First 4 bytes are `4f 56 45 31` = "OVE1")

**Unencrypted file**:
```
00000000  7b 22 63 6f 6e 74 65 6e  74 73 22 3a 5b 7b 22 70  |{"contents":[{"p|
```

### Method 2: Restart and Read Back

Read the same imported file through the API before and after restarting the server. Verify its content matches and inspect the physical backend file header as above. This checks that the deployment reloads the expected key and can read its ciphertext.

Do not treat an arbitrary exception in an internal provider call as an encryption test: argument errors, missing dependencies, and network errors can all fail before decryption.

## Migration Guide

### Migrating from Unencrypted to Encrypted

Enabling encryption does not rewrite existing plaintext files. They remain readable for backward compatibility, while new writes use encryption. To encrypt existing public scopes, migrate them through OVPack into a new, empty encrypted storage environment:

1. Stop application writes and create a logical backup while the original unencrypted environment is running:

```bash
ov backup ./backups/before-encryption.ovpack
```

2. Stop OpenViking. Enable encryption and point the storage configuration at a **new, empty** workspace/backend. Keep the original data and encryption key backup until verification is complete.
3. Start the encrypted environment. In API key mode, first create the target account and a restore operator with an admin key, then point the CLI at the target using that key, as described in [Full Backup and Restore](09-ovpack.md#full-backup-and-restore). Restore writes the package content through the encrypted storage layer:

Account initialization creates scope directories, so `fail` would reject this restore. Confirm that the target contains only the newly created account's initial content before using `overwrite` below. If it already contains business data, stop and follow the target-backup and conflict-review steps in the OVPack guide instead.

```bash
ov restore ./backups/before-encryption.ovpack --on-conflict overwrite
```

4. Verify resource, user, session, and index data before switching traffic. OVPack excludes runtime/internal state such as queues, uploads, locks, and watches; recreate or validate those separately.

See [OVPack Import and Export](09-ovpack.md#full-backup-and-restore) for supported scopes and restore options.

### Switching Key Providers

Keep the original provider and key available while exporting a logical OVPack backup. Restore it into a separate empty deployment configured with the new provider, following the migration steps above. Verify contents, access permissions, and rebuilt indexes before switching traffic. Changing the provider setting in place does not re-encrypt existing files.

## Troubleshooting

### Key File Not Found

```
Error: Key file not found: ~/.openviking/master.key
```

**Solution**:
1. Check file path is correct
2. Use absolute path
3. Ensure `~` is properly expanded (use `expanduser()`)

### Vault Connection Failed

```
Error: Failed to connect to Vault
```

**Solution**:
1. Check if Vault service is running
2. Verify `address` configuration
3. Check network connectivity and firewall
4. Confirm Token is valid and not expired

### Volcengine KMS Authentication Failed

```
Error: Invalid credentials
```

**Solution**:
1. Check Access Key and Secret Key are correct
2. Confirm key has sufficient permissions
3. Verify region configuration is correct

### Existing ciphertext cannot be read

Check that the deployment still has the original root key, provider settings, account identity, and intact ciphertext. For Vault, retain both the Transit key and the KV entry containing the wrapped root key; for KMS, retain the KMS key and local wrapped-key file. Do not generate a replacement root key to repair access to existing ciphertext.

Partial reads load and authenticate the full encrypted file, then return the requested plaintext slice. If a partial read returns ciphertext, record the server version and compare full and partial reads on a copied test file. Check the storage encryption configuration and relevant fixes before upgrading, and keep the original data and keys available for rollback.
