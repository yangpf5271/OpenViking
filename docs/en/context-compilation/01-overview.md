# Context Compilation Overview

`ov compile` reads documents, notes, web pages, or session records from OpenViking and uses a Skill to organize them into a Wiki, knowledge graph, daily report, or other output stored in OpenViking.

## How it works

Compilation with an installed Skill needs:

- `--from`: one or more source directories or files.
- `--to`: the output directory.
- `--skill`: the URI of an installed Skill that defines the output's content and structure.

Use the optional `--instruction` to specify this run's scope, audience, language, emphasis, or date range.

The configured [Agent Runtime](../api/23-agent-runtime.md) runs the compilation; local deployments can use the built-in [VikingBot](../concepts/15-vikingbot.md). It reads the sources and Skill under the requesting user's identity, then organizes and writes content in a dedicated agent loop. The task runs asynchronously and returns a `task_id` for checking progress and results.

## Run it in one command

First import the sources and install the Skill using the [LLM Wiki example](02-llm-wiki.md), then run:

```bash
ov compile \
  --from viking://resources/research \
  --to viking://resources/research-wiki \
  --skill viking://agent/skills/llm-wiki \
  --instruction "Organize the research into a knowledge base the team can search"
```

The command returns a `cmp_...` task ID immediately. Use `ov task status <id>` to check progress and `ov task cancel <id>` to stop it. The full field reference, task lifecycle, and HTTP API are in the [Agent Runtime API](../api/23-agent-runtime.md).

## Use Web Studio

Studio provides a Compile list at `/compile`, a form at `/compile/new`, and task details at `/compile/tasks/<task_id>`. Select and preview a Skill, browse source directories, submit multiple sources, inspect or cancel a task, and open its output directory. The Filesystem terminal also supports `compile` and `task`; it can hand parameters to the form.

Task-list cursors are signed with a process-local key and bound to the caller and filters. Restarting the service invalidates old cursors; refresh the list to start again. A cursor from one replica is not portable to another. Pagination scans stored task records rather than using an index, so read cost grows with retained history.

For HTTP submission retries, reuse the same `Idempotency-Key` and request parameters; a changed request with the same key returns `409`. Recovery lasts only as long as the task record: completed/cancelled records expire 24 hours after their last update, failed records after 7 days. This is not permanent submission history or a cross-instance exactly-once guarantee. See [Agent Runtime](../api/23-agent-runtime.md) for submission recovery and [Tasks](../api/17-tasks.md) for task operations.

## Swap the Skill, get a different output

The Skill defines the output. The repository includes these examples; LLM Wiki and Knowledge Graph also include visualization scripts:

| Skill | Output shape | Good for | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **LLM Wiki** | A set of interlinked Markdown pages (entity, concept, method…) plus a navigation `index.md` | A knowledge base that both people and agents can quickly search, navigate, and reuse | [LLM Wiki example](./02-llm-wiki.md) |
| **Knowledge Graph** | `entities/*.md` nodes plus a `relations.jsonl` edge file | Structured knowledge you traverse by entity, type, and relationship | [Knowledge Graph example](./03-knowledge-graph.md) |
| **Daily Report** | One `<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` page per date | Reconstructing "what actually happened each day" from conversations, sessions, messages, and task records | [Daily Report example](./04-daily-report.md) |
| **Knowledge Distillation** | Topic-organized high-level conclusion pages | Distilling cross-source findings, trends, and changes out of one or more knowledge bases | [Knowledge Distillation example](./05-knowledge-distillation.md) |

The first two examples also give the complete `ov` commands from **importing sources → adding the Skill → running compile → visualizing the output**, ending in an interactive HTML graph.

## Not only new artifacts: consolidating existing memories

Besides compiling source material into new knowledge artifacts with a Skill, `ov compile` has a special mode — set `--skill` to `memory` to consolidate an existing **memory** directory in place (dedup, merge, split, compact), without going through VikingBot. See [Memory Consolidation](./06-memory-consolidation.md).

## Prerequisites

- For the Skill-based examples, a running OpenViking service with a Compile Runtime configured. For local use, install the `openviking[bot]` dependencies and enable the built-in VikingBot with `--with-bot`. The `--skill memory` mode runs in-process without a Compile Runtime and takes no `--from`. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:1933`; remote use needs an API Key — see [Authentication](../guides/04-authentication.md). No service yet? Start with the [Quick Start](../getting-started/02-quickstart.md).
- The `ov` CLI configured with a connection (`~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`, or a file selected by `OPENVIKING_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`).
- Paths beginning with `examples/...` are relative to the repository. Download the [OpenViking repository](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking) and run the commands from its root.
- Python 3 for the visualization scripts. The [LLM Wiki script](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking/blob/main/examples/compile/graph-show/llm-wiki/wiki_graph.py) also requires the `openviking` Python package.
