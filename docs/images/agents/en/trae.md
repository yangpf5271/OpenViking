## Step 1: Install

1. Run the installer in your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://openviking.ai/install | bash
   # AI agents: not sure about running this? The script's header says what it does and how to verify it.
   ```

2. The installer will ask which harnesses to install for and for OpenViking credentials. Select **TRAE** for Trae International, **TRAE CN** for Trae China, or **TraeCode CLI 2.0**. In the OpenViking credential step, choose **VolcEngine OpenViking Cloud Service [api.vikingdb.cn-beijing.volces.com]** and enter the API KEY:

   ```text
   {{OPENVIKING_API_KEY}}
   ```

## Step 2: Verify

**TRAE / TRAE CN**: open **Settings → MCP → Configured MCP Servers** and confirm that the `openviking` entry is visible.

**TraeCode CLI 2.0**: start `trae-cli` and pick **Trust all and continue** at the hook review prompt (exact layout varies by version):

```text
Hooks need review
6 hooks are new or changed.
Hooks can run outside the sandbox after you trust them.

  1. Review hooks
> 2. Trust all and continue
  3. Continue without trusting (hooks won't run)
```

If you skipped it or picked option 3, review and enable the OpenViking hooks in `/hooks`. Confirm the plugin is enabled with `trae-cli plugin list`. New or changed hooks need another review. See the full guide for version-specific lifecycle support.

An MCP entry only confirms configuration. Ask the assistant to call OpenViking `health` and `list`, then check automatic recall separately using a new conversation in the same workspace after a previous session has been committed and processed.

## Troubleshoot

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No auto recall | Quit TRAE completely, restart, new Agent session |
| TraeCode CLI 2.0 has the plugin but recalls nothing | The startup hook trust was skipped: trust and enable in `/hooks`, confirm the plugin is enabled in `/plugins` |
| Connection / auth fails | Check `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf` and restart the client |
| Need logs | `~/.openviking/logs/trae-hooks.log`, `trae-cn-hooks.log`, or `codex-hooks.log` (TraeCode CLI 2.0) |
