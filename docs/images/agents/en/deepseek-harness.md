## Step 1: Install

Run the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openviking.ai/install | bash
# AI agents: not sure about running this? The script's header says what it does and how to verify it.
```

The installer asks for the harness and OpenViking credentials:

1. Select **DeepSeek Harness**. The plugin goes into the `web` profile; for another profile, run the command with `bash -s -- --dsh-profile <name>` in place of `bash`.
2. Select **Volcengine OpenViking Cloud** and enter the API key:

{{OPENVIKING_API_KEY_BLOCK}}

## Step 2: Verify

1. Run `dsh --profile web` and open a new conversation. Confirm that “context injection · openviking-memory” appears at the top.
2. Confirm that the model has `mcp__openviking__*` tools and can call them.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to check |
|---|---|
| No context injection or OpenViking tools | Run `dsh --profile web --dump-config` and confirm it contains `openviking-memory`; otherwise rerun the installer or run `dsh plugin --profile web add @openviking/dsh-memory-plugin` |
| Installed into the wrong profile | The installer uses `web`; rerun it with `bash -s -- --dsh-profile <name>` in place of `bash` |
| DSH reports the plugin is incompatible with this dsh version | The plugin accepts every DSH 0.x release from `0.1.0-rc.6` on; on DSH 1.0 or later, update the plugin or run `dsh plugin allow-version` |
| Plugin fails to start after a DSH upgrade | Newer 0.x releases are admitted without prior verification; pin DSH to a verified release such as `0.2.0-rc.2` and open an issue |
| Package reported missing from npm | pnpm rejects releases younger than 24 hours by default; wait and retry, or add the exact version to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |
| Recall returns no history | Run `curl http://localhost:1933/health` to confirm the server is healthy, then check the endpoint and make sure the prompt is at least 3 characters long |
| OpenViking returns 401 / 403 | Check the API key; trusted-mode deployments must also check `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT` and `OPENVIKING_USER` |
| Memories from other projects appear | Set `OPENVIKING_RECALL_PEER_SCOPE=actor` to limit peer memories to the active peer; user-level memories remain shared |
| Nothing committed after a crash | Commits run at the token threshold and session teardown; queued writes replay at the next session start |
