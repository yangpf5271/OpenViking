DeerFlow can use OpenViking as a long-term memory backend through MemoryManager. After the integration is enabled, DeerFlow writes conversation messages to OpenViking, recalls relevant memories before model calls, and injects them into the context.

This setup supports one DeerFlow user with an ordinary OpenViking USER API key in `api_key` mode. `owner_user_id: default` applies when DeerFlow authentication is disabled; otherwise set the authenticated DeerFlow user's ID. It does not provision separate credentials for multiple users. Remove old trusted-mode identity defaults before switching. See [DeerFlow's authentication and migration notes](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/blob/main/docs/OPENVIKING.md#authentication-boundary).

## Step 1: Configure OpenViking credentials

Edit the `.env` file in the DeerFlow project root and add the API key:

{{OPENVIKING_API_KEY_BLOCK}}

## Step 2: Update DeerFlow memory configuration

Open `config.yaml` in the project root, find the `memory:` section, and replace the default DeerMem configuration with OpenViking:

```yaml
memory:
  enabled: true
  injection_enabled: true
  shutdown_flush_timeout_seconds: 30
  manager_class: openviking
  mode: middleware
  backend_config:
    base_url: {{OPENVIKING_BASE_URL}}
    owner_user_id: default
    api_key_env: OPENVIKING_API_KEY
    startup_policy: fail_fast
    failure_policy:
      read: fail_open
      write: log_and_drop
    retrieval:
      top_k: 8
      score_threshold: 0.25
      max_injection_chars: 12000
      content_mode: overview
      injection_query: >-
        user profile preferences important entities events ongoing goals
        constraints and prior decisions
```

## Step 3: Restart DeerFlow

Save `.env` and `config.yaml`, then restart DeerFlow:

```bash
make dev
```

## Step 4: Verify OpenViking integration

Check the Gateway logs from the project root:

```bash
grep -i "memory manager resolved\|openviking\|deermem" logs/gateway.log
```

Successful log examples:

```text
Memory manager resolved: OpenVikingMemoryManager (manager_class='openviking')
HTTP Request: GET {{OPENVIKING_BASE_URL}}/health "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
```

## Step 5: Verify memory write and recall

These logs show accepted requests and injected context. After extraction finishes, start another conversation as the same user and ask about a distinctive fact from the previous session to verify memory recall:

```bash
grep -Ei "messages/batch|commit|search/find|has_memory" logs/gateway.log | tail -100
```

Successful log examples:

```text
/messages/batch "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
/commit "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
/search/find "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
has_memory=True
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| DeerFlow fails to start and reports an OpenViking configuration error | The OpenViking section in `config.yaml` is incomplete or malformed | Check that `manager_class: openviking` is configured and verify fields such as `base_url` and `api_key_env` |
| DeerFlow is not connected to OpenViking | `memory.manager_class` was not changed to `openviking`, or the service was not restarted after the config change | Save the configuration, restart DeerFlow, and confirm that `OpenVikingMemoryManager` appears in the logs |
| Remote authentication fails with 401 or 403 | The OpenViking API Key is missing, incorrect, or unauthorized | Check whether `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` is correctly set in `.env` |
| Retrieval fails but DeerFlow still replies | The current configuration uses `read: fail_open`, which is expected behavior | If OpenViking retrieval fails, memory will not be injected, but the main Agent response will continue |
| A response is generated but memory write fails | The current configuration uses `write: log_and_drop`, so write failures are recorded in logs | Check and fix OpenViking service, network, and authentication settings. New messages can continue to be written after recovery |
| Messages have been written, but memories are not visible immediately | OpenViking summarization and memory extraction are asynchronous | Wait for background tasks to finish, then check again |
| Memory operations are still pending during service shutdown | The system waits up to `shutdown_flush_timeout_seconds` for them to finish | If the wait times out, or OpenViking is unavailable during shutdown, some writes may not complete. Increase the timeout if needed and check OpenViking network/service availability during shutdown |
